Misc
====

Just a bunch of little exercises to keep the mind sharp.
It should be noted that as of September 28th 2014 there is a skew in the statistics towards XLST and Scala due to my taking
the Coursera Scala course taught by Martin Odersky. This will probably continue until after I'm done, though I'm sure the Java,
Python and Haskell shares will equalize given time. Occasionally, because despite what any one says about the type system, I write in Go and enjoy it. I apologize for any sense of misrepresentation you may experience due to
this discrepancy.

Mostly, I write in Python, then Java, then Scala, then Haskell, then Erlang, then Elixir, then OCaml, then (hopefully)
F#; these are my languages. If you have any questions, shoot me an email at stephen.lazaro@gmail.com. It should be understood that
I make an effort to rewrite algorithms in multiple languages in accordance with their idioms. I want to learn how to program
not how to program x language of choice.
