#Five silent philosophers sit at a table with bowls of spaghetti
#on each philosophers right there is a fork
#Each philosopher must alternately think and eat
#However, they can only eat when they have both left and right forks
#Each fork can only be used by one philosopher at a time
#After a philosopher finishes, he sets down both forks
#A philosopher can start picking up forks on the right, or the left
#Eating is not limited by the amount of spaghetti, there is in principle an infinite supply
#Desigh a concurrent algorithm such that they will not starve!
